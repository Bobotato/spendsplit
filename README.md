This is a full stack application I'm building to help me and my friends log and split our expenses. I'm building this as a way to continually familiarise and update myself on tech stacks that are not within my job scope. I am also building this as an alternative to other paid/open-source services to suit the needs of myself and my friend groups without having to pay.

## Stack

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
- [MaterialUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) 
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Todo

- Implement receipt scanning and parsing using PyTesseract
- Store payment QR codes for group members paying up
- Export group expenses to CSV
- Mobile friendly layouts
- End to End testing with Cypress
